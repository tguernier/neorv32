* `mip` CSR is read-only - pending IRQs can be cleared using `mie`
* The physical memory protection (**PMP**) only supports `NAPOT` mode yet and a minimal granularity of 8 bytes
* The `A` extension only implements `lr.w` and `sc.w` instructions yet. However, these instructions are sufficient to emulate all remaining AMO operations

## FPGA Implementation Results

### NEORV32 CPU

This chapter shows exemplary implementation results of the NEORV32 CPU for an **Intel Cyclone IV EP4CE22F17C6N FPGA** on
a DE0-nano board. The design was synthesized using **Intel Quartus Prime Lite 20.1** ("balanced implementation"). The timing
information is derived from the Timing Analyzer / Slow 1200mV 0C Model. If not otherwise specified, the default configuration
of the CPU's generics is assumed (e.g. no physical memory protection, no hardware performance monitors).
No constraints were used at all.

Results generated for hardware version [`1.5.3.2`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### NEORV32 Processor - Exemplary FPGA Setups

:information_source: Check out the [`boards`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/boards) folder for exemplary setups targeting various FPGA boards.

The following tables show exemplary processor implementation results for different FPGA platforms. The processor setups use *the default peripheral configuration* (like no *CFS* and no *TRNG*),
no external memory interface and only internal instruction and data memories. IMEM uses 16kB and DMEM uses 8kB memory space.

Results generated for hardware version [`1.4.9.0`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**_Notes_**
* The "default" implementation strategy of the according toolchain is used.
* The Lattice iCE40 UltraPlus setup uses the FPGA's SPRAM memory primitives for the internal IMEM and DMEM (each 64kb).
* The clock frequencies marked with a "c" are constrained clocks. The remaining ones are _f_max_ results from the place and route timing reports.
* The Upduino and the Arty board have on-board SPI flash memories for storing the FPGA configuration. These device can also be used by the default NEORV32
bootloader to store and automatically boot an application program after reset (both tested successfully).
* The setups with `PMP` implement 2 regions with a minimal granularity of 64kB.
* No HPM counters are implemented.

## Performance

### CoreMark Benchmark

The [CoreMark CPU benchmark](https://www.eembc.org/coremark) was executed on the NEORV32 and is available in the
[sw/example/coremark](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/sw/example/coremark) project folder. This benchmark
tests the capabilities of a CPU itself rather than the functions provided by the whole system / SoC.

~~~
**Configuration**
Hardware:       32kB IMEM, 8kB DMEM, no caches, 100MHz clock
CoreMark:       2000 iterations, MEM_METHOD is MEM_STACK
Compiler:       RISCV32-GCC 10.1.0 (rv32i toolchain)
Compiler flags: default, see makefile
Optimization:   -O3
Peripherals:    UART for printing the results
~~~

Results generated for hardware version [`1.4.9.8`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

| CPU (including `Zicsr` extension)           | Executable Size | Optimization | CoreMark Score | CoreMarks/MHz |
|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| `rv32i`                                     |    28 756 bytes |        `-O3` |          36.36 |    **0.3636** |
| `rv32imc`                                   |    22 008 bytes |        `-O3` |          68.97 |    **0.6897** |
| `rv32imc` + `FAST_MUL_EN` + `FAST_SHIFT_EN` |    22 008 bytes |        `-O3` |          90.91 |    **0.9091** |

The `FAST_MUL_EN` configuration uses DSPs for the multiplier of the `M` extension (enabled via the `FAST_MUL_EN` generic). The `FAST_SHIFT_EN` configuration
uses a barrel shifter for CPU shift operations (enabled via the `FAST_SHIFT_EN` generic).

When the `C` extension is enabled, branches to an unaligned uncompressed instruction require additional instruction fetch cycles.

[[back to top](#The-NEORV32-RISC-V-Processor)]


### Instruction Cycles

The NEORV32 CPU is based on a two-stages pipelined architecutre. Each stage uses a multi-cycle processing scheme. Hence,
each instruction requires several clock cycles to execute (2 cycles for ALU operations, ..., 40 cycles for divisions).
The average CPI (cycles per instruction) depends on the instruction mix of a specific applications and also on the available
CPU extensions. *By default* the CPU-internal shifter (e.g. for the `SLL` instruction) as well as the multiplier and divider of the
`M` extension use a bit-serial approach and require several cycles for completion.

The following table shows the performance results for successfully running 2000 CoreMark
iterations, which reflects a pretty good "real-life" work load. The average CPI is computed by
dividing the total number of required clock cycles (only the timed core to avoid distortion due to IO wait cycles; sampled via the `cycle[h]` CSRs)
by the number of executed instructions (`instret[h]` CSRs). The executables were generated using optimization `-O3`.

Results generated for hardware version [`1.4.9.8`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Top Entities

The top entity of the **NEORV32 Processor** (SoC) is [`rtl/core/neorv32_top.vhd`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/core/neorv32_top.vhd),
which provides a Wishbone b4-compatoible bus interface.

:information_source: It is recommended to use the processor setup even if you want to **use the CPU in stand-alone mode**. Simply disable all the processor-internal
modules via the generics and you will get a "CPU wrapper" that already provides a minimal CPU environment and an external memory interface (like AXI4).
This setup also allows to further use the default bootloader and software framework. From this base you can start building your own processor system.

Use the top's generics to configure the system according to your needs. Each generic is initilized with the default configuration.
Detailed information regarding the interface signals and configuration generics can be found in
the [:page_facing_up: NEORV32 data sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stnolting/neorv32/master/docs/NEORV32.pdf) (pdf).

All signals of the top entity are of type *std_ulogic* or *std_ulogic_vector*, respectively
(except for the processor's TWI signals, which are of type *std_logic*). Leave all unused output ports unconnected and tie all unused
input ports to zero.

**Alternative top entities**, like the simplified ["hello world" test setup](#Create-a-new-Hardware-Project) or CPU/Processor
wrappers with resolved port signal types (i.e. *std_logic*), can be found in [`rtl/top_templates`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/top_templates).

[[back to top](#The-NEORV32-RISC-V-Processor)]


### AXI4 Connectivity

Via the [`rtl/top_templates/neorv32_top_axi4lite.vhd`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/top_templates/neorv32_top_axi4lite.vhd)
wrapper the NEORV32 provides an **AXI4-Lite** compatible master interface. This wrapper instantiates the default
[NEORV32 processor top entitiy](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/core/neorv32_top.vhd) and implements a Wishbone to AXI4-Lite bridge.

The AXI4-Lite interface has been tested using Xilinx Vivado 19.2 block designer:

![AXI-SoC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stnolting/neorv32/master/docs/figures/neorv32_axi_soc.png)

The processor was packed as custom IP using `neorv32_top_axi4lite.vhd` as top entity. The AXI interface is automatically detected by the packager.
All remaining IO interfaces are available as custom signals. The configuration generics are available via the "customize IP" dialog.
In the figure above the resulting IP block is named "neorv32_top_axi4lite_v1_0".
*(Note: Use Syntheiss option "global" when generating the block design to maintain the internal TWI tri-state drivers.)*

The setup uses an AXI interconnect to attach two block RAMs to the processor. Since the processor in this example is configured *without* IMEM and DMEM,
the attached block RAMs are used for storing instructions and data: the first RAM is used as instruction memory
and is mapped to address `0x00000000 - 0x00003fff` (16kB), the second RAM is used as data memory and is mapped to address `0x80000000 - 0x80001fff` (8kB).

## Getting Started

This overview is just a short excerpt from the *Let's Get It Started* section of the NEORV32 documentary:

[:page_facing_up: NEORV32 data sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stnolting/neorv32/master/docs/NEORV32.pdf)


### 0. Build the Documentation

This step is optional since there are pre-built versions of the [processor data sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stnolting/neorv32/master/docs/NEORV32.pdf)
and the [software documentation](https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/files.html). If you want to build the documentation by yourself:

**NEORV32 Data Sheet**

To build the data sheet open a console and navigate to the project's `docs` folder. Run `$ sh make_datasheet.sh` (make sure `asciidoctor-pdf` is installed).
This will take all the `asciidoc` sources from [`docs/src_adoc`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/docs/src_adoc) to generate `docs/NEORV32.pdf`.

**Software Framework Documentation**

Make sure `doxygen` is installed. Open a console and navigate to the project's `docs` folder and run `$ doxygen Doxyfile`. This will create (if not already there)
a new folder `docs/doxygen_build/html` where doxygen will generate the HTML-based documentation pages. Open `docs/doxygen_build/html/files.html` to get started.


### 1. Get the Toolchain

At first you need a **RISC-V GCC toolchain**. You can either [download the sources](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain)
and build the toolchain by yourself, or you can download a prebuilt one and install it.

To build the toolchain by yourself, follow the official [build instructions](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain).
Make sure to use the `ilp32` or `ilp32e` ABI.

**Alternatively**, you can download a prebuilt toolchain. I have uploaded the toolchains I am using to GitHub. These toolchains
were compiled on a 64-bit x86 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Ubuntu on Windows, actually). Download the toolchain of choice: 
[:octocat: github.com/stnolting/riscv-gcc-prebuilt](https://github.com/stnolting/riscv-gcc-prebuilt)

You can also use the toolchains provided by [SiFive](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases). These are 64-bit toolchains that can also emit 32-bit
RISC-V code. They were compiled for more sophisticated machines (`rv32imac`) so make sure the according NEORV32 hardware extensions are enabled.

:warning: Keep in mind that – for instance – a `rv32imc` toolchain only provides library code compiled with compressed and
`mul`/`div` instructions! Hence, this code cannot be executed (without emulation) on an architecture without these extensions!

To check everything works fine, make sure `GNU Make` and a native `GCC` compiler are installed.
Test the installation of the RISC-V toolchain by navigating to an [example program project](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/sw/example) like
`sw/example/blink_led` and running:

    neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make check


### 2. Download the NEORV32 Project

Get the sources of the NEORV32 Processor project. The simplest way is using `git clone` (suggested for easy project updates via `git pull`):

    $ git clone https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32.git

Alternatively, you can either download a specific [release](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/releases) or get the most recent version
of this project as [`*.zip` file](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/archive/master.zip).


### 3. Create a new FPGA Project

:information_source: If want to use a script-based exemplary project setup check out the [`boards`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/boards) folder,
which provides exemplary setups targeting various FPGA boards.

Create a new project with your FPGA design tool of choice. Add all the `*.vhd` files from the [`rtl/core`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl)
folder to this project. Make sure to add these files to a **new design library** called `neorv32`.

You can either instantiate the [processor's top entity](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/core/neorv32_top.vhd) or one of its
[wrappers](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/top_templates) in your own project. If you just want to try thing out,
you can use the simple [**test setup** (`rtl/top_templates/neorv32_test_setup.vhd`)](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/top_templates/neorv32_test_setup.vhd) as top entity.

![neorv32 test setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stnolting/neorv32/master/docs/figures/neorv32_test_setup.png)


This test setup instantiates the processor and implements most of the peripherals and some ISA extensions. Only the UART0 communications lines, clock, reset and some
GPIO output signals are propagated as actual top entity interface signals. Basically, it is a FPGA version of a "hello world" example:

```vhdl
  entity neorv32_test_setup is
    port (
      -- Global control --
      clk_i       : in  std_ulogic := '0'; -- global clock, rising edge
      rstn_i      : in  std_ulogic := '0'; -- global reset, low-active, async
      -- GPIO --
      gpio_o      : out std_ulogic_vector(7 downto 0); -- parallel output
      -- UART0 --
      uart0_txd_o : out std_ulogic;       -- UART0 send data
      uart0_rxd_i : in  std_ulogic := '0' -- UART0 receive data
    );
  end neorv32_test_setup;
```


### 4. Compile an Example Program

The NEORV32 project includes several [example program project](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/sw/example) from
which you can start your own application. There are example programs to check out the processor's peripheral like I2C or the true-random number generator.
And of course there is also a port of [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/sw/example/game_of_life) available.

Simply compile one of these projects using

    neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make clean_all exe

This will create a NEORV32 *executable* `neorv32_exe.bin` in the same folder, which you can upload via the bootloader.


### 5. Upload the Executable via the Bootloader

Connect your FPGA board via UART to your computer and open the according port to interface with the fancy NEORV32 bootloader. The bootloader
uses the following default UART configuration:

* 19200 Baud
* 8 data bits
* 1 stop bit
* No parity bits
* No transmission / flow control protocol (raw bytes only)
* Newline on `\r\n` (carriage return & newline) - also for sent data

Use the bootloader console to upload the `neorv32_exe.bin` executable gerated during application compiling and *run* your application.

```

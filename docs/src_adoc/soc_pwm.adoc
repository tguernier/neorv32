**Theory of Operation**

The PWM controller implements a pulse-width modulation controller with four independent channels and 8-
bit resolution per channel. It is based on an 8-bit counter with four programmable threshold comparators that
control the actual duty cycle of each channel. The controller can be used to drive a fancy RGB-LED with 24-
bit true color, to dim LCD back-lights or even for "analog" control. An external integrator (RC low-pass filter)
can be used to smooth the generated "analog" signals.

The PWM controller is activated by setting the _PWM_CT_EN_ bit in the module's control register _PWM_CT_. When this
bit is cleared, the unit is reset and all PWM output channels are set to zero.
The 8-bit duty cycle for each channel, which represents the channel's "intensity", is defined via the according 8-bit_ PWM_DUTY_CHx_ byte in the _PWM_DUTY_ register.
Based on the duty cycle _PWM_DUTY_CHx_ the according intensity of each channel can be computed by the following formula:

_**Intensity~x~**_ = _PWM_DUTY_CHx_ / (2^8^)

The frequency of the generated PWM signals is defined by the PWM operating clock. This clock is derived
from the main processor clock and divided by a prescaler via the 3-bit PWM_CT_PRSCx in the unit's control
register. The following prescalers are available:

The resulting PWM frequency is defined by:

_**f~PWM~**_ = _f~main~[Hz]_ / (2^8^ * `clock_prescaler`)

[TIP]
A more sophisticated frequency generation option is provided by by the numerically-controlled oscillator
module (see section <<_numerically_controller_oscillator_nco>>).
